# Homework for Universsity of Michigan's Programming Language Course
My version of homework from every part of University of Michigan's Programming Languages course on coursera

# About my participation
I found this course in the curriculum of this "online degree" - https://github.com/ossu/computer-science
I didn't do the certificate, only audited a course and did homework on my own.

# Course
The course is divided into 3 parts.
Part A covers the basics of SML, explains crucial ideas of functional programming and talks about interesting features of SML such as, for example, typechecker.
Part B moves on to Racket. The most interesting sectin of this part is, in my opinion, homework where you implement a simple programming language (called MULP) inside Racket. One section also discusses main differences betweem ML and Racket.
