# Homework
My versions of homeworks from every part of University of Michigan's Programming Languages course on coursera

# About my participation
I found this course in the curriculum of this "online degree" - [link] (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)

# Course
The course is divided into 3 parts.
Part A covers the basics of SML, explains crucial ideas of functional programming and talks about interesting features of SML such as, for example, typechecker.
Part B moves on to Racket. The most interesting sectin of this part is, in my opinion, homework where you implement a simple programming language (called MULP) inside Racket. One section also discusses main differences betweem ML and Racket.
